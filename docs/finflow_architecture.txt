    res.json({ accessToken: token });
  });

  export default router;


     • OpenAPI Spec: We include Swagger docs. For example, /auth/login might be documented as:




                                                      4
         paths:
           /auth/login:
             post:
                summary: "User login"
                 requestBody:
                   content:
                     application/json:
                       schema:
                          type: object
                          properties:
                            email: { type: string }
                            password: { type: string }
                 responses:
                   '200':
                     description: "JWT token"
                     content:
                       application/json:
                          schema:
                            type: object
                            properties:
                              accessToken: { type: string }


       All other routes are similarly defined. The Auth service’s README details setup (OAuth client IDs, JWT
       secret, DB migrations) and includes its own Dockerfile and .env.example (showing PORT ,
       DATABASE_URL , JWT_SECRET , OAuth client credentials, etc).

Security best practices are followed: JWTs for stateless auth, HTTPS enforced, and CORS configured tightly.
We grant roles (e.g. ADMIN , USER ) and apply middleware to protect certain routes (e.g. only ADMIN can
view all users). For example, a middleware might check the JWT and role claim on each request.


Payments Service (Node.js + Express)

The Payments service handles initiating and tracking payments (credit card, ACH, etc.). It integrates with
payment processors (e.g. Stripe or Plaid) via API/webhooks.


     • Endpoints: POST /payments/charge , GET /payments/:id , POST /payments/webhook to
       receive external payment status updates.
     • DB Schema: Payments table with (id, userId, amount, currency, status,
       processorData, createdAt) .
     • Integration: Uses a payment SDK. Example: Stripe’s Node library to create charges.

     • Example Code Snippet (charging):



         // src/routes/payments.ts
         import express from 'express';
         import stripe from 'stripe';




                                                      5
   const stripeClient = new stripe(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET!, { apiVersion:
   '2020-08-27' });
   const router = express.Router();

   router.post('/charge', async (req, res) => {
     const { amount, currency, source, userId } = req.body;
     try {
       const charge = await stripeClient.charges.create({ amount, currency,
   source });
       // Save payment to DB (skipped for brevity)
       // Publish event to Kafka
       await kafkaProducer.send({ topic: 'payment_completed', messages: [{
   key: charge.id, value: JSON.stringify({ userId, amount, status:
   'completed' }) }] });
       res.json({ id: charge.id, status: charge.status });
     } catch (err) {
       console.error(err);
       res.status(500).json({ error: 'Payment failed' });
     }
   });

   // Webhook endpoint for async updates
   router.post('/webhook', express.raw({ type: 'application/json' }), (req,
   res) => {
     const sig = req.headers['stripe-signature'];
     const event = stripeClient.webhooks.constructEvent(req.body, sig!,
   process.env.STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET!);
     if (event.type === 'charge.succeeded') {
       const data = event.data.object as any;
       // Update DB and possibly re-publish to Kafka
     }
     res.sendStatus(200);
   });
   export default router;



• Kafka Integration: After a successful charge, the service publishes a payment_completed event
 (JSON) on a Kafka topic so accounting or analytics can update records. This decouples confirmation
 from processing.


• PCI-DSS Compliance: We never store raw card data; Stripe’s tokens are used instead. Sensitive fields
  (like last4 digits) are encrypted before DB insertion. All traffic is over TLS.
• Logging & Errors: Uses a logger (e.g. Winston) to record payment attempts and errors.




                                               6
Accounting Service (Node.js + Express)

This service manages invoices, ledgers, and reconciliations. It tracks money owed and paid.


     • Endpoints: POST /accounting/invoices (create invoice), GET /accounting/invoices ,
       POST /accounting/ledger-entry , etc.
     • DB Schema: Invoices (id, userId, client, amount, dueDate, status) , JournalEntries
       (id, invoiceId, debitAccount, creditAccount, amount, date) .
     • Business Logic: Creating an invoice generates initial ledger entries (debit AccountsReceivable, credit
       SalesRevenue). When a payment_completed event is consumed, the invoice status is updated to
       “Paid” and reversal ledger entry is created.
     • Example Code (invoice creation):


         router.post('/invoices', async (req, res) => {
           const { userId, client, amount, dueDate } = req.body;
           const invoice = await prisma.invoice.create({ data: { userId, client,
         amount, dueDate, status: 'PENDING' } });
           // Publish invoice_created event
           await kafkaProducer.send({ topic: 'invoice_created', messages: [{ key:
         invoice.id, value: JSON.stringify(invoice) }] });
           res.json(invoice);
         });


     • Kafka Consumer: Listens to payment_completed topic. On receiving a payment event, it marks
       the corresponding invoice as paid and records the bank transaction in its ledger.
     • OpenAPI: Swagger docs define schemas for invoices and ledger entries. For example, POST /
       accounting/ledger-entry might accept { invoiceId, debitAccount, creditAccount,
       amount, date } .
     • Validation: We validate inputs (e.g. positive amounts, valid dates) and return clear error responses.
       Integration tests (e.g. using Jest + Supertest) ensure the endpoints behave as expected.
     • Reconciliation: The service can reconcile ledger entries with payments, marking mismatches. This
       might be an asynchronous job or API action.

AI Analytics Service (Python + FastAPI)

This microservice provides machine learning analytics: real-time cash flow forecasting and automated
expense categorization. It’s built in Python (FastAPI) and uses libraries like pandas, scikit-learn, and
statsmodels.


     • Endpoints:
     • POST /analytics/forecast takes recent revenue/expense time-series data and returns future
      cash flow predictions.
     • POST /analytics/categorize takes a transaction description and returns a spending category
       (via a trained NLP model).
     • Modeling: We train time-series models (e.g. ARIMA or Facebook Prophet) on historical data to
       forecast cash flow. We also train a text classification model (e.g. logistic regression or a small
       transformer) on labeled transactions.



                                                       7
• Example Training Script: ( train_models.py )


   import pandas as pd
   from fbprophet import Prophet
   from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
   import joblib

   # Synthetic data generation (for demo)
   df = pd.read_csv('synthetic_transactions.csv') # contains date, amount,
   description, category
   # Train forecast model
   ts = df.groupby('date').sum().reset_index().rename(columns={'date':'ds',
   'amount':'y'})
   model = Prophet(yearly_seasonality=True)
   model.fit(ts)
   model.save('cashflow_prophet_model.pkl')
   # Train categorization model
   X = df['description']
   y = df['category']
   from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
   vect = TfidfVectorizer()
   X_vec = vect.fit_transform(X)
   clf = LogisticRegression()
   clf.fit(X_vec, y)
   joblib.dump({'model': clf, 'vectorizer': vect}, 'category_model.joblib')
