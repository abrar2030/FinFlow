# FinFlow Infrastructure Architecture Design

## Overview
This document outlines the Docker and Kubernetes architecture for the FinFlow application, which consists of multiple microservices, databases, message brokers, and monitoring components.

## Application Components
- Frontend (React)
- API Gateway
- Auth Service
- Payments Service
- Accounting Service
- Analytics Service
- Credit Engine
- PostgreSQL Databases (separate for each service)
- Kafka & Zookeeper
- Monitoring (Prometheus & Grafana)

## Docker Architecture

### Container Strategy
1. **Base Images**:
   - Frontend: Node 20-alpine
   - Backend Services: Node 20-alpine for JS/TS services, Python 3.11-slim for Python services
   - Databases: PostgreSQL 14
   - Message Broker: Confluent Kafka & Zookeeper
   - Monitoring: Prometheus, Grafana, Elasticsearch, Fluentd, Kibana

2. **Multi-stage Builds**:
   - Development and production-optimized containers
   - Separate build and runtime stages to minimize image size
   - Consistent environment variables across stages

3. **Image Tagging Strategy**:
   - Semantic versioning (major.minor.patch)
   - Latest tag for most recent stable build
   - Git commit hash for precise version tracking

4. **Security Considerations**:
   - Non-root users for all containers
   - Minimal base images
   - Vulnerability scanning in CI/CD pipeline
   - Secrets management via Kubernetes secrets

## Kubernetes Architecture

### Cluster Design
1. **Environment Separation**:
   - Development, Staging, Production clusters
   - Namespace strategy: `finflow-{env}-{component}`

2. **Node Pools**:
   - Application nodes: General-purpose for microservices
   - Database nodes: Storage-optimized for databases
   - Monitoring nodes: Memory-optimized for monitoring stack

3. **High Availability**:
   - Multi-zone deployment
   - Minimum 3 control plane nodes
   - Auto-scaling node groups

### Resource Management
1. **Resource Allocation**:
   - CPU/Memory requests and limits for all containers
   - Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA) for all services
   - Priority classes for critical services

2. **Storage**:
   - Persistent volumes for databases and stateful services
   - Storage classes for different performance needs
   - Backup and restore strategy

### Networking
1. **Service Mesh**:
   - Istio for advanced traffic management
   - Service-to-service authentication
   - Traffic encryption

2. **Ingress**:
   - NGINX Ingress Controller
   - TLS termination
   - Rate limiting and WAF integration

3. **Network Policies**:
   - Zero-trust network model
   - Explicit allow policies between services
   - Egress control for external dependencies

### Security
1. **RBAC**:
   - Role-based access control for all components
   - Service accounts with minimal permissions
   - Pod security policies

2. **Secret Management**:
   - External secrets management (HashiCorp Vault)
   - Encryption at rest
   - Secret rotation

## Deployment Strategy
1. **CI/CD Integration**:
   - GitOps workflow with ArgoCD
   - Progressive delivery with canary deployments
   - Automated rollbacks

2. **Configuration Management**:
   - ConfigMaps for non-sensitive configuration
   - Environment-specific values via Helm
   - Feature flags for controlled rollouts

## Monitoring and Observability
1. **Metrics**:
   - Prometheus for metrics collection
   - Grafana for visualization
   - Custom dashboards for business KPIs

2. **Logging**:
   - EFK stack (Elasticsearch, Fluentd, Kibana)
   - Structured logging format
   - Log retention policies

3. **Tracing**:
   - Jaeger for distributed tracing
   - OpenTelemetry instrumentation
   - End-to-end request tracking

## Disaster Recovery
1. **Backup Strategy**:
   - Regular database backups
   - Configuration backups
   - Cross-region replication

2. **Recovery Plan**:
   - RTO and RPO definitions
   - Automated recovery procedures
   - Regular DR testing

## Automation
1. **Infrastructure as Code**:
   - Terraform for cloud resources
   - Kubernetes manifests for application deployment
   - Helm charts for complex deployments

2. **Configuration Management**:
   - Ansible for server configuration
   - Packer for image building
   - GitOps for declarative state

3. **Operational Scripts**:
   - Automated scaling
   - Backup and restore
   - Health checks and self-healing
