# FinFlow Infrastructure Documentation

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive documentation for the FinFlow infrastructure implementation. The infrastructure has been designed with a focus on scalability, reliability, security, and maintainability, using modern DevOps practices and tools.

## Architecture

The FinFlow infrastructure is built using a microservices architecture deployed on Kubernetes, with the following key components:

### Core Components
- **Frontend**: Modern React application with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- **API Gateway**: Entry point for all client requests
- **Microservices**:
  - Auth Service: Handles authentication and authorization
  - Payments Service: Manages payment processing
  - Accounting Service: Handles financial accounting
  - Analytics Service: Provides business intelligence
  - Credit Engine: Manages credit scoring and decisions

### Infrastructure Components
- **Kubernetes Cluster**: Orchestrates containerized applications
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL instances for each service
- **Messaging**: Kafka for event-driven communication
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, and Elasticsearch/Kibana
- **Logging**: Fluentd for log aggregation

## Infrastructure Components

### Docker

Docker is used to containerize all application components. Each service has its own Dockerfile optimized for production use with multi-stage builds to minimize image size and improve security.

Key features:
- Multi-stage builds
- Non-root users
- Minimal base images
- Health checks
- Proper layer caching

### Kubernetes

Kubernetes is used for orchestrating the containerized applications, providing:
- High availability
- Scalability
- Self-healing
- Resource management
- Service discovery

The Kubernetes manifests are organized by service and include:
- Deployments
- Services
- Ingress configurations
- ConfigMaps and Secrets
- StatefulSets for databases
- Horizontal Pod Autoscalers

### Ansible

Ansible is used for configuration management and deployment automation, with roles for:
- Common server setup
- Docker installation and configuration
- Kubernetes cluster setup
- Monitoring system deployment
- Application deployment

The Ansible playbooks are idempotent and can be used for initial setup as well as ongoing maintenance.

### Terraform

Terraform is used for infrastructure as code, providing:
- Reproducible infrastructure
- Version-controlled configurations
- Dependency management
- State management

The Terraform modules include:
- VPC: Network infrastructure
- EKS: Kubernetes cluster
- RDS: Database instances
- ECR: Container registry
- Route53: DNS management
- Bastion: Secure access point

### Monitoring and Logging

The monitoring and logging stack includes:
- **Prometheus**: Metrics collection and alerting
- **Grafana**: Visualization and dashboards
- **Fluentd**: Log collection and forwarding
- **Elasticsearch**: Log storage and search
- **Kibana**: Log visualization

Custom dashboards are provided for:
- System overview
- Microservices performance
- Database metrics
- Kafka monitoring

## Automation Scripts

Several automation scripts are provided to simplify common operations:

- **setup.sh**: Initial infrastructure setup
- **deploy.sh**: Application deployment
- **backup.sh**: Database and configuration backup
- **monitoring-setup.sh**: Monitoring stack setup

## Security Considerations

The infrastructure implements several security best practices:
- Network segmentation with VPC
- Least privilege principle for IAM roles
- Encrypted data at rest and in transit
- Secure secrets management
- Regular security updates
- Network policies for pod-to-pod communication
- Resource quotas and limits

## Scaling Considerations

The infrastructure is designed to scale horizontally:
- Stateless services can scale with Horizontal Pod Autoscalers
- Database scaling with read replicas
- Kafka scaling with additional brokers
- Monitoring stack scaling with additional Prometheus instances

## Disaster Recovery

Disaster recovery is implemented through:
- Regular automated backups
- Multi-AZ deployments
- Stateful service replication
- Infrastructure as code for quick recovery

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- AWS account with appropriate permissions
- kubectl installed
- Terraform installed
- Ansible installed
- AWS CLI configured

### Deployment Steps

1. Initialize Terraform:
   ```
   cd terraform
   terraform init
   ```

2. Apply Terraform configuration:
   ```
   terraform apply -var-file=environments/prod.tfvars
   ```

3. Configure kubectl:
   ```
   aws eks update-kubeconfig --region us-west-2 --name finflow-cluster
   ```

4. Run Ansible playbook:
   ```
   cd ansible
   ansible-playbook -i inventory/prod site.yml
   ```

5. Deploy applications:
   ```
   ./scripts/deploy.sh
   ```

6. Set up monitoring:
   ```
   ./scripts/monitoring-setup.sh
   ```

## Maintenance

### Regular Maintenance Tasks
- Apply security updates
- Rotate credentials
- Review and optimize resource allocation
- Check backup integrity
- Review monitoring alerts

### Troubleshooting

Common issues and their solutions:
- Pod scheduling failures: Check resource constraints
- Database connection issues: Verify network policies
- Monitoring alerts: Check service health and logs
- Deployment failures: Check container logs and events

## Conclusion

This infrastructure implementation provides a robust, scalable, and secure foundation for the FinFlow application. The use of infrastructure as code, containerization, and automation ensures reproducibility and maintainability.
