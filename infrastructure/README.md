# FinFlow Infrastructure Implementation

## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive overview of the FinFlow infrastructure implementation, including Docker, Kubernetes, Ansible, Terraform, and monitoring components. The infrastructure has been designed for scalability, reliability, and maintainability.

## Infrastructure Components

### Docker
- Optimized Dockerfiles for all microservices
- Multi-stage builds for efficient image sizes
- Non-root user execution for enhanced security
- Consistent environment variables and configuration

### Kubernetes
- Complete deployment manifests for all services
- Service and ingress configurations
- StatefulSets for databases with persistent storage
- Resource limits and requests for optimal performance
- Network policies for secure communication

### Ansible
- Server configuration playbooks
- Deployment automation
- Maintenance tasks
- Backup and restore procedures

### Terraform
- AWS infrastructure as code
- Modular design for reusability
- VPC, EKS, RDS, ECR, and Route53 configurations
- Bastion host for secure access

### Monitoring
- Prometheus for metrics collection
- Grafana for visualization with pre-configured dashboards
- EFK stack (Elasticsearch, Fluentd, Kibana) for logging
- Alerting configuration for critical events

## Automation Scripts
- `setup.sh`: Initial environment setup
- `deploy.sh`: Application deployment
- `backup.sh`: Database and configuration backup
- `monitoring-setup.sh`: Monitoring stack deployment
- `validate.sh`: Infrastructure validation

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate permissions
- kubectl installed
- Terraform v1.0+ installed
- Ansible v2.9+ installed
- Helm v3+ installed

### Deployment Steps
1. Initialize Terraform:
   ```
   cd terraform
   terraform init
   ```

2. Apply Terraform configuration:
   ```
   terraform apply -var-file=environments/prod.tfvars
   ```

3. Configure kubectl:
   ```
   aws eks update-kubeconfig --name finflow-cluster --region us-west-2
   ```

4. Run the setup script:
   ```
   ./scripts/setup.sh
   ```

5. Deploy the application:
   ```
   ./scripts/deploy.sh
   ```

6. Set up monitoring:
   ```
   ./scripts/monitoring-setup.sh
   ```

7. Validate the deployment:
   ```
   ./scripts/validate.sh
   ```

## Maintenance

### Scaling
- Horizontal Pod Autoscaling is configured for all services
- Node autoscaling is enabled in the EKS cluster

### Backup and Restore
- Run the backup script daily:
  ```
  ./scripts/backup.sh
  ```

- Restore from backup:
  ```
  ./scripts/backup.sh --restore <backup-date>
  ```

### Monitoring
- Grafana dashboard: https://grafana.finflow.example.com
- Prometheus: https://prometheus.finflow.example.com
- Kibana: https://kibana.finflow.example.com

## Security Considerations
- All secrets are managed through Kubernetes secrets
- Network policies restrict communication between services
- RBAC is configured for all components
- TLS is enabled for all ingress resources

## Troubleshooting
- Check logs in Kibana
- View metrics in Grafana
- Use `kubectl describe` and `kubectl logs` for detailed information
- Consult the validation script output for common issues

## Conclusion
This infrastructure implementation provides a robust, scalable, and secure foundation for the FinFlow application. The automation scripts and configuration files ensure consistent deployment and operation across environments.
