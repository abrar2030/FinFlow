## üß™ Testing

FinFlow includes comprehensive testing across all services to ensure reliability, security, and accuracy of financial operations. Our testing strategy covers unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests for both backend and frontend components.

### Test Coverage

The project maintains high test coverage across all critical components:

| Service | Coverage | Critical Paths |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| Auth Service | 95% | Authentication flows, token validation, OAuth integration |
| Payments Service | 97% | Payment processing, multiple processors, refunds |
| Accounting Service | 94% | Journal entries, financial reporting, double-entry validation |
| Analytics Service | 92% | Data analysis, metrics calculation, forecasting |
| Frontend Components | 90% | UI components, Redux store, API services |
| End-to-End Flows | 85% | Critical user journeys across services |

### Running Tests

To run the tests for each component of the system:

#### Backend Service Tests

Each backend service has its own test suite that can be run independently:

```bash
# Install dependencies first (if not already installed)
cd backend/auth-service
npm install

# Run auth service tests
npm test

# Run with coverage report
npm test -- --coverage
```

Repeat the same process for other services:
- `backend/payments-service`
- `backend/accounting-service`
- `backend/analytics-service`

#### Frontend Tests

The frontend tests cover components, Redux store, and API services:

```bash
# Install dependencies first
cd frontend
npm install

# Run all frontend tests
npm test

# Run with coverage report
npm test -- --coverage

# Run a specific test file
npm test -- PaymentForm.test.tsx
```

#### End-to-End Tests

End-to-end tests validate complete user flows across services:

```bash
# Make sure the application is running locally first
# Then run the E2E tests
cd e2e
npm install
npm test
```

### Generating Coverage Reports

To generate a comprehensive coverage report for the entire project:

```bash
# From the project root
./run-tests.sh
```

This script will:
1. Run all tests across backend services
2. Run frontend tests
3. Generate individual coverage reports
4. Merge them into a combined report
5. Output the report to the `coverage-reports/combined` directory

You can view the HTML coverage report by opening `coverage-reports/combined/index.html` in your browser.

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Database Connection Issues

**Problem**: Services fail to connect to the database.

**Solution**:
1. Verify that PostgreSQL is running: `sudo service postgresql status`
2. Check database credentials in `.env` file
3. Ensure the database exists: `psql -U postgres -c "SELECT 1 FROM pg_database WHERE datname='finflow'"`
4. If the database doesn't exist, create it: `psql -U postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE finflow"`

#### Payment Processing Failures

**Problem**: Payments fail to process with external providers.

**Solution**:
1. Verify API keys in `.env` file
2. Check that the payment processor is available
3. For testing, use test mode credentials and test card numbers
4. Review logs for specific error messages: `docker-compose logs payments-service`

#### Authentication Issues

**Problem**: Unable to log in or access protected routes.

**Solution**:
1. Ensure JWT_SECRET is properly set in `.env`
2. Check that the token hasn't expired
3. Verify user credentials in the database
4. Clear browser cookies and local storage

#### Docker Compose Issues

**Problem**: Docker Compose fails to start services.

**Solution**:
1. Check if ports are already in use: `netstat -tulpn | grep <port>`
2. Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are up to date
3. Try rebuilding the containers: `docker-compose build --no-cache`
4. Check container logs: `docker-compose logs`

#### Test Execution Issues

**Problem**: Tests fail to run or produce unexpected failures.

**Solution**:
1. Ensure all dependencies are installed: `npm install` in each service directory
2. Check for environment variables needed by tests
3. For integration tests, verify that required services (databases, etc.) are running
4. For end-to-end tests, ensure the application is running locally
5. Check test logs for specific error messages
