## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

FinFlow is built on a modern microservices architecture, ensuring modularity, scalability, and resilience.

### Service Architecture

The platform is composed of several independent backend services, each responsible for a specific business domain:

| Service | Primary Function |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Auth Service** | User authentication, authorization, and session management. |
| **Payments Service** | Payment processing, gateway integration, and transaction handling. |
| **Accounting Service** | Double-entry accounting, ledger management, and financial reporting. |
| **Analytics Service** | Data analysis, metrics calculation, and visualization. |
| **Credit Engine** | Credit scoring, loan application processing, and risk assessment. |

These services are supported by a robust infrastructure layer:
*   **API Gateway**: Handles request routing, load balancing, and composition.
*   **Service Mesh**: Manages inter-service communication, security, and observability.
*   **Message Broker**: Facilitates event-driven communication between services.
*   **Monitoring Stack**: Provides logging, metrics, and alerting for operational visibility.

### Event-Driven Communication

FinFlow utilizes an event-driven architecture to ensure loose coupling and real-time data flow. Key event types include:
1.  **Payment Events**: Trigger accounting entries, analytics updates, and credit assessments.
2.  **User Events**: Manage authentication state and authorization updates across services.
3.  **System Events**: Handle infrastructure scaling and monitoring alerts.
