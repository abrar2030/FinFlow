## üß™ Testing

FinFlow includes comprehensive testing across all services to ensure reliability, security, and accuracy of financial operations. Our testing strategy covers unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests for both backend and frontend components.

### Test Coverage

The project maintains high test coverage across all critical components:

| Service | Coverage | Critical Paths |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| Auth Service | 95% | Authentication flows, token validation, OAuth integration |
| Payments Service | 97% | Payment processing, multiple processors, refunds |
| Accounting Service | 94% | Journal entries, financial reporting, double-entry validation |
| Analytics Service | 92% | Data analysis, metrics calculation, forecasting |
| Web Frontend | 90% | UI components, Redux store, API services |
| Mobile Frontend | 96% | All screens, Redux integration, navigation flows |
| End-to-End Flows | 85% | Critical user journeys across services |

### Running Tests

To run the tests for each component of the system:

#### Backend Service Tests

Each backend service has its own test suite that can be run independently:

```bash
# Install dependencies first (if not already installed)
cd backend/auth-service
npm install

# Run auth service tests
npm test

# Run with coverage report
npm test -- --coverage
```

Repeat the same process for other services:
- `backend/payments-service`
- `backend/accounting-service`
- `backend/analytics-service`

#### Web Frontend Tests

The web frontend tests cover components, Redux store, and API services:

```bash
# Install dependencies first
cd frontend
npm install

# Run all frontend tests
npm test

# Run with coverage report
npm test -- --coverage

# Run a specific test file
npm test -- PaymentForm.test.tsx
```

#### Mobile Frontend Tests

The mobile frontend has comprehensive test coverage for all screens and components:

```bash
# Install dependencies first
cd mobile-frontend
npm install

# Run all mobile tests
npm test

# Run with coverage report
npm test -- --coverage

# Run a specific test file
npm test -- LoginScreen.test.tsx
```

#### End-to-End Tests

End-to-end tests validate complete user flows across services:

```bash
# Make sure the application is running locally first
# Then run the E2E tests
cd e2e
npm install
npm test
```

### Generating Coverage Reports

To generate a comprehensive coverage report for the entire project:

```bash
# From the project root
./run-tests.sh
```

This script will:
1. Run all tests across backend services
2. Run frontend tests
3. Run mobile frontend tests
4. Generate individual coverage reports
5. Merge them into a combined report
6. Output the report to the `coverage-reports/combined` directory

You can view the HTML coverage report by opening `coverage-reports/combined/index.html` in your browser.

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Database Connection Issues

**Problem**: Services fail to connect to the database.

**Solution**:
1. Verify that PostgreSQL is running: `sudo service postgresql status`
2. Check database credentials in `.env` file
3. Ensure the database exists: `psql -U postgres -c "SELECT 1 FROM pg_database WHERE datname='finflow'"`
4. If the database doesn't exist, create it: `psql -U postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE finflow"`

#### Payment Processing Failures

**Problem**: Payments fail to process with external providers.

**Solution**:
1. Verify API keys in `.env` file
2. Check that the payment processor is available
3. For testing, use test mode credentials and test card numbers
4. Review logs for specific error messages: `docker-compose logs payments-service`

#### Authentication Issues

**Problem**: Unable to log in or access protected routes.

**Solution**:
1. Ensure JWT_SECRET is properly set in `.env`
2. Check that the token hasn't expired
3. Verify user credentials in the database
4. Clear browser cookies and local storage

#### Mobile App Issues

**Problem**: Mobile app fails to connect to backend services.

**Solution**:
1. Verify API endpoint configuration in the mobile app
2. Check network connectivity on the mobile device
3. Ensure backend services are running and accessible
4. Clear app cache and restart the application
5. Check for version compatibility issues

#### Docker Compose Issues

**Problem**: Docker Compose fails to start services.

**Solution**:
1. Check if ports are already in use: `netstat -tulpn | grep <port>`
2. Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are up to date
3. Try rebuilding the containers: `docker-compose build --no-cache`
4. Check container logs: `docker-compose logs`

#### Test Execution Issues

**Problem**: Tests fail to run or produce unexpected failures.

**Solution**:
1. Ensure all dependencies are installed: `npm install` in each service directory
2. Check for environment variables needed by tests
3. For integration tests, verify that required services (databases, etc.) are running
4. For end-to-end tests, ensure the application is running locally
5. Check test logs for specific error messages
