# Mobile Frontend

## Overview

The mobile-frontend directory contains the React Native application that serves as the mobile client for the FinFlow platform. This cross-platform mobile application provides users with a comprehensive financial management experience on iOS and Android devices. The mobile frontend delivers core functionality including account management, transaction tracking, budget planning, payment processing, and financial analytics in an intuitive, responsive interface optimized for mobile devices.

## Architecture

The mobile application follows a modern React Native architecture with TypeScript for type safety and improved developer experience. The codebase is organized using a feature-based structure, where related components, screens, and logic are grouped together based on functionality rather than technical role. This approach enhances code maintainability and facilitates feature development by keeping related code in proximity.

The application implements a unidirectional data flow pattern using Redux for state management, ensuring predictable state updates and simplified debugging. API communication is handled through a centralized service layer that interfaces with the FinFlow backend services.

## Technology Stack

The mobile frontend is built with:

- React Native (v0.79.2) as the cross-platform framework
- TypeScript for type-safe development
- Expo for simplified development workflow and access to native APIs
- React Navigation for screen navigation and routing
- Redux and Redux Toolkit for state management
- Axios for API communication
- React Native Paper for UI components
- Jest and React Native Testing Library for testing

## Directory Structure

The src directory contains the application source code organized into several key areas:

The components directory houses reusable UI components that are shared across multiple screens.

The screens directory contains screen components organized by feature area (dashboard, accounts, transactions, etc.).

The navigation directory manages the application's navigation structure, including tab navigation, stack navigation, and drawer navigation.

The redux directory implements the state management layer with slices for different domains.

The services directory provides API integration and other external service connections.

The utils directory contains helper functions, constants, and utility classes.

The hooks directory includes custom React hooks for shared logic.

The assets directory outside src contains static resources like images, fonts, and other media files.

## Setup and Development

To set up the mobile frontend development environment:

1. Ensure you have Node.js (v16+) and npm installed on your development machine.

2. Install Expo CLI globally:

```bash
npm install -g expo-cli
```

3. Install project dependencies:

```bash
cd mobile-frontend
npm install
```

4. Configure environment variables by creating a .env file based on the .env.example template.

5. Start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

6. Use the Expo Go app on your physical device or an emulator/simulator to run the application.

## Building and Deployment

The mobile application can be built for production using Expo's build service or EAS (Expo Application Services):

1. Configure app.json with appropriate settings for your build.

2. Build for iOS:

```bash
expo build:ios
```

3. Build for Android:

```bash
expo build:android
```

4. For more advanced build configurations, use EAS:

```bash
eas build --platform all
```

## Testing

The mobile frontend includes comprehensive testing:

Unit tests for individual components and utilities using Jest.

Integration tests for complex interactions and state management.

End-to-end tests for critical user flows.

To run tests:

```bash
npm test
```

For test coverage reports:

```bash
npm run test:coverage
```

## State Management

The application uses Redux for state management with a structured approach:

Redux Toolkit simplifies store configuration and reducer logic.

Redux slices organize state by domain (auth, accounts, transactions, etc.).

Thunks handle asynchronous operations like API calls.

Selectors provide optimized access to state data.

## API Integration

The mobile frontend communicates with backend services through a centralized API layer:

API services are organized by domain and feature.

Request interceptors handle authentication token management.

Response interceptors process common error patterns.

Retry logic handles temporary network issues.

## Authentication and Security

The application implements secure authentication:

Token-based authentication with JWT.

Secure storage of credentials using AsyncStorage with encryption.

Biometric authentication options where available.

Automatic session refresh and token rotation.

## Offline Support

The mobile application provides offline capabilities:

Local storage of critical data for offline access.

Queuing of transactions when offline.

Background synchronization when connectivity is restored.

Conflict resolution for data modified while offline.

## Performance Optimization

Several strategies ensure optimal mobile performance:

Virtualized lists for handling large datasets.

Memoization to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
 
Image optimization and lazy loading.

Code splitting and dynamic imports.

## Accessibility

The application is designed with accessibility in mind:

Screen reader support with appropriate labels.

Sufficient color contrast for readability.

Scalable text that respects system font size settings.

Touch targets sized appropriately for all users.

The mobile frontend provides a comprehensive, user-friendly interface to the FinFlow platform, enabling users to manage their finances effectively on mobile devices.
