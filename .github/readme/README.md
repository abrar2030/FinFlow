3. **security-updates**: Applies security updates to dependencies.
   - Runs npm audit fix across all services
   - Creates pull requests with security fixes

**Environment Variables and Secrets:**
- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Used for creating pull requests

**Automation Process:**
- Automatically creates separate branches for updates
- Generates detailed PR descriptions with update information
- Applies labels for easier PR categorization

### Security Scanning (`security-scan.yml`)

This workflow performs comprehensive security scanning across the codebase, dependencies, and container images.

**Triggers:**
- Push to `main` or `develop` branches
- Pull requests targeting `main` or `develop` branches
- Scheduled run weekly on Sundays at midnight UTC
- Manual trigger via workflow dispatch

**Key Jobs:**

1. **dependency-scanning**: Scans dependencies for vulnerabilities.
   - Uses npm audit to check for known vulnerabilities
   - Integrates with Snyk for deeper vulnerability scanning

2. **code-scanning**: Performs static code analysis.
   - Uses GitHub's CodeQL for advanced code analysis
   - Runs ESLint with security-focused rules

3. **secret-scanning**: Scans for exposed secrets and credentials.
   - Uses Gitleaks to detect secrets in code
   - Uses TruffleHog for additional secret detection

4. **container-scanning**: Scans container images for vulnerabilities.
   - Builds Docker images for scanning
   - Uses Trivy to scan for container vulnerabilities
   - Uploads results to GitHub Security tab

5. **compliance-checks**: Verifies compliance with security best practices.
   - Checks for security headers in API responses
   - Verifies proper CORS configuration
   - Ensures authentication middleware is in place

6. **security-report**: Generates a comprehensive security report.
   - Compiles results from all security scans
   - Uploads report as an artifact

**Environment Variables and Secrets:**

## Workflow Interdependencies

The workflows in this project are designed with the following dependencies:

1. **CI/CD Pipeline**:
   - Internal job dependencies: Lint → Test → Build → Docker → Deploy
   - Environment-specific deployments based on branch

2. **Dependency Updates**:
   - Independent of other workflows
   - Creates pull requests that trigger the CI/CD pipeline

3. **Security Scanning**:
   - Can run independently or as part of CI/CD
   - Generates reports that inform dependency updates

This architecture ensures that:
- Code quality is verified before testing
- Tests must pass before building
- Building must succeed before deployment
- Production deployments only occur for the `main` branch
- Dependencies are regularly updated
- Security is continuously monitored

## Environment Setup

### Staging Environment

The staging environment is configured with the following components:

1. **Kubernetes Cluster**: AWS EKS cluster named `FinFlow-staging-cluster`
2. **Namespace**: `FinFlow-staging`
3. **Services**: Deployed as separate Kubernetes deployments

### Production Environment

The production environment is configured with the following components:

1. **Kubernetes Cluster**: AWS EKS cluster named `FinFlow-production-cluster`

3. **Services**: Deployed as separate Kubernetes deployments
4. **URL**: https://FinFlow.abrar2030.com

### Secrets Management

The following secrets are required for the workflows to function properly:

- `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME`: Username for DockerHub authentication
- `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN`: Token for DockerHub authentication
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: AWS access key for EKS access
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: AWS secret key for EKS access
- `SNYK_TOKEN`: Authentication token for Snyk
- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Automatically provided by GitHub Actions

These secrets should be configured in the repository settings under "Secrets and variables" → "Actions".

## Best Practices and Recommendations

### Adding New Services

When adding a new service to the project:

1. Add the service to the matrix in the CI/CD workflow
2. Add the service to the dependency updates workflow
3. Add the service to the security scanning workflow
4. Create appropriate Kubernetes manifests in the kubernetes directory

### Troubleshooting

Common issues and their solutions:

1. **Failed Tests**: Check the test logs for specific failures and fix the underlying issues
2. **Docker Build Failures**: Verify Dockerfile syntax and dependencies
3. **Deployment Failures**: Check AWS credentials and Kubernetes manifest validity
4. **Dependency Update Failures**: Review compatibility issues in the PR description

### Security Considerations

- Secrets are securely managed by GitHub Actions
- Regular security scans identify vulnerabilities
- Dependency updates address known security issues
- Container scanning ensures secure deployments

## Workflow Customization

To customize the workflows for specific needs:

1. **Modifying Build Parameters**: Update the build commands in the CI/CD workflow
2. **Changing Deployment Targets**: Update the Kubernetes manifests and deployment steps
3. **Adjusting Security Thresholds**: Modify the severity levels in security scanning

## Conclusion
