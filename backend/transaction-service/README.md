# Transaction Service

A comprehensive transaction processing service for FinFlow, providing robust transaction validation, database optimization, and caching for high-volume financial transactions.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Transaction Validation**: Multi-layered validation system with risk scoring
- **Optimized Database Operations**: Efficient query patterns for high-volume transaction processing
- **Advanced Caching**: Multi-level caching with primary and fallback strategies
- **Batch Processing**: Efficient handling of transaction batches
- **High Performance**: Designed for high-throughput financial environments

## Architecture

The Transaction Service is built with a modular architecture:

- **Models**: Pydantic models for request/response validation
- **Validation**: Comprehensive transaction validation logic
- **Database**: Optimized database operations with connection pooling
- **Cache**: Multi-level caching system for high performance
- **API**: FastAPI endpoints for transaction processing

## API Endpoints

- `POST /transactions`: Create and validate a new transaction
- `POST /transactions/batch`: Process a batch of transactions
- `GET /transactions/{transaction_id}`: Get transaction details
- `GET /transactions`: Query transactions with filters
- `GET /health`: Service health check

## Validation Features

- Amount validation against configurable thresholds
- Account validation (existence, sufficient funds)
- Transaction velocity checks (frequency limits)
- Business rules validation
- AML/CFT compliance checks
- Fraud pattern detection
- Risk scoring and categorization

## Database Optimizations

- Connection pooling for efficient resource usage
- Optimized query patterns with proper indexing
- Batch operations for high-volume scenarios
- Query result caching for frequently accessed data
- Performance monitoring and slow query detection

## Caching Strategy

- Multi-level cache with primary and fallback options
- Configurable TTL for different data types
- Automatic cache invalidation on updates
- Cache statistics for monitoring
- Redis-based implementation with fallback options

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Redis for caching
- PostgreSQL or compatible database
- Required Python packages (see requirements.txt)

### Configuration

The service can be configured through environment variables:

- `DATABASE_URL`: Database connection string
- `REDIS_HOST`: Redis host for caching
- `REDIS_PORT`: Redis port
- `PORT`: Service port (default: 8001)

### Running the Service

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the service
python -m src.main
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
python -m unittest discover tests

# Run specific test
python -m unittest tests.test_validation
```

## Integration

The Transaction Service integrates with other FinFlow services:

- **Authentication Service**: For user authentication and authorization
- **Account Service**: For account validation and balance checks
- **Compliance Service**: For regulatory compliance checks
- **Notification Service**: For transaction notifications
- **Audit Service**: For comprehensive audit logging

## Performance Considerations

- Designed to handle 1000+ transactions per second
- Optimized for low latency (<100ms per transaction)
- Horizontal scaling support through stateless design
- Efficient resource usage with connection pooling and caching
