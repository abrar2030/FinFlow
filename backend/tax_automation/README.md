```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Tax Calculation

```python
from tax_automation import TaxCalculationEngine, Transaction, TaxProfile
from decimal import Decimal
from datetime import datetime

# Create tax engine
engine = TaxCalculationEngine()

# Create transaction
transaction = Transaction(
    transaction_id="txn_001",
    amount=Decimal('1000.00'),
    transaction_type="purchase",
    origin_jurisdiction="UK",
    destination_jurisdiction="UK",
    product_service_code="GOODS",
    timestamp=datetime.now(),
    payer_entity_id="user_001",
    payee_entity_id="merchant_001"
)

# Calculate taxes
result = engine.calculate_taxes(transaction)
print(f"Total tax: {result.total_tax_amount}")
```

### Tax Rule Management

```python
from tax_automation import TaxRuleManager

# Create rule manager
manager = TaxRuleManager()

# Create new tax rule
rule_data = {
    'rule_id': 'VAT_UK_STANDARD',
    'jurisdiction': 'UK',
    'tax_type': 'vat',
    'effective_date': '2024-01-01',
    'rate': 20.0,
    'calculation_method': 'percentage',
    'conditions': {'min_amount': 0.01},
    'description': 'UK Standard VAT Rate'
}

rule = manager.create_tax_rule(rule_data)
```

### Compliance Checks

```python
from tax_automation import InternationalComplianceManager

# Create compliance manager
compliance = InternationalComplianceManager()

# Create entity profile
profile_data = {
    'entity_id': 'user_001',
    'entity_type': 'individual',
    'full_name': 'John Doe',
    'nationality': 'US',
    'country_of_residence': 'US'
}

profile = compliance.create_entity_profile(profile_data)

# Perform comprehensive compliance check
results = compliance.perform_comprehensive_compliance_check('user_001')
```

## API Endpoints

### Tax Calculation API

- `POST /api/tax/calculate` - Calculate tax for a transaction
- `GET /api/tax/rules` - Get tax rules with optional filtering
- `POST /api/tax/rules` - Create new tax rule
- `PUT /api/tax/rules/{rule_id}` - Update existing tax rule
- `DELETE /api/tax/rules/{rule_id}` - Deactivate tax rule

## Configuration

### Database Configuration

The module uses SQLite databases by default:
- Tax rules: `tax_rules.db`
- Compliance data: `compliance.db`

Custom database paths can be specified:

```python
from tax_automation import TaxRuleManager, InternationalComplianceManager

tax_manager = TaxRuleManager("custom_tax_rules.db")
compliance_manager = InternationalComplianceManager("custom_compliance.db")
```

### Tax Rule Configuration

Tax rules support various configuration options:

- **Jurisdictions**: Country or region codes (e.g., "UK", "US", "CA")
- **Tax Types**: VAT, Sales Tax, Income Tax, Withholding Tax, Capital Gains Tax, Corporate Tax
- **Calculation Methods**: Percentage, Fixed Amount, Tiered, Progressive
- **Conditions**: Minimum amount, transaction types, entity types, product codes, exemptions

### Compliance Configuration

Compliance checks can be configured for different requirements:

- **KYC Requirements**: Document types required by entity type
- **AML Rules**: Transaction monitoring thresholds and patterns
- **FATCA Indicators**: US person identification criteria
- **Data Residency**: Geographic data storage requirements

## Testing

Run the comprehensive test suite:

```bash
python -m tax_automation.tests
```

The test suite includes:
- Unit tests for all core components
- Integration tests for end-to-end workflows
- Compliance validation tests
- API endpoint tests
