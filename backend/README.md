# FinFlow Backend: Microservices Architecture

## Financial Operations & Workflow Platform - Backend Services

FinFlow's backend is a comprehensive, polyglot microservices architecture designed to power a modern financial operations platform. It provides secure authentication, real-time transaction processing, double-entry accounting, advanced analytics, and machine learning-driven credit management. The architecture is built for **scalability**, **resilience**, and **maintainability**, with each service focusing on a specific domain of financial operations.

## Overview

The FinFlow backend is a collection of independent services that communicate primarily through a message broker (Kafka) and RESTful APIs. This design allows for independent scaling, technology flexibility, and isolated development cycles, ensuring the platform can evolve rapidly while maintaining high availability and consistency.

## Architecture

### Technology Stack

The FinFlow backend employs a **polyglot persistence** and **polyglot programming** approach, leveraging the best tool for each specific service's requirements.

| Category | Technology | Purpose | Services Used In |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Language (API)** | **TypeScript/Node.js** (Express/Fastify) | Core business logic, high-concurrency I/O operations. | Auth, Accounting, Analytics, Payments, Integration, Multi-Tenant, Performance, Realtime Analytics |
| **Primary Language (ML/Data)** | **Python** (FastAPI, Flask) | Machine learning, data processing, and complex financial calculations. | Transaction, Credit Engine, AI Features, Compliance, Tax Automation |
| **Database** | **PostgreSQL** | Primary relational data store (e.g., Accounting, Auth, Credit). | Accounting, Auth, Credit Engine, Compliance |
| **Message Broker** | **Apache Kafka** | Asynchronous, event-driven communication between services. | All services (for events like `TransactionCreated`, `PaymentProcessed`) |
| **Caching/Session** | **Redis** | High-speed data caching and session management. | Auth, Analytics, Payments |
| **ML/Data Science** | **Scikit-learn, Pandas, XGBoost** | Credit scoring, forecasting, and financial advisory. | Credit Engine, AI Features |

### Microservices Overview

The backend is structured into distinct, domain-specific services.

| `credit-engine` | Machine Learning-based Credit Scoring, Risk Assessment, Loan Offer Generation. | Python | FastAPI, Scikit-learn, Joblib |
| `ai-features-service` | Advanced AI/ML for Cash Flow Forecasting, Financial Advisory, and Predictive Modeling. | Python | FastAPI, XGBoost, Prophet, TensorFlow |
| `compliance-service` | Regulatory Compliance (GDPR, PSD2, AML/CFT) and Audit Trail Management. | Python | General Python, PostgreSQL |
| `tax_automation` | Automated Tax Calculation and Rule Management (e.g., VAT, Sales Tax). | Python | Flask |
| `integration-service` | Third-party Financial System Integrations (e.g., QuickBooks, Xero). | TypeScript | Node.js, Express |
| `multi-tenant-service` | Data Isolation, Tenant Management, and Multi-Tenant Architecture Support. | TypeScript | Node.js, Express |
| `realtime-analytics-service` | Real-time Anomaly Detection and Streaming Analytics. | TypeScript | Node.js, Kafka Streaming |
| `performance-service` | Database Optimization and Performance Monitoring. | TypeScript | Node.js, Database Optimizer |

### Common Components

The `common` directory contains shared utilities to ensure consistency and reduce boilerplate across the Node.js/TypeScript services.

| Component File | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `app.ts` | Standardized application setup and middleware configuration. |
| `database.ts` | Centralized database connection and ORM initialization (primarily for PostgreSQL). |
| `index.ts` | Entry point for the common module. |
| `kafka.ts` | Kafka producer and consumer utilities for event-driven communication. |
| `logger.ts` | Centralized, structured logging configuration for all services. |
| `passport.ts` | Shared Passport.js configuration for authentication strategies. |
| `server.ts` | Standardized HTTP server creation and startup logic. |

### Event-Driven Communication

Communication between services is decoupled using **Apache Kafka** as the central event bus.

| Event Type | Producer Service | Consumer Services | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `TransactionCreated` | Transaction Service | Accounting, Analytics, Realtime Analytics | Notifies other services of a new transaction for ledger updates, reporting, and anomaly checks. |
| `PaymentProcessed` | Payments Service | Accounting, Credit Engine | Triggers accounting entries and updates credit risk models. |
| `UserRegistered` | Auth Service | Multi-Tenant, Analytics | Initializes tenant data and user-specific analytics profiles. |
| `ComplianceAlert` | Compliance Service | Auth, Performance | Signals a regulatory issue (e.g., AML flag) that may require action. |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You will need the following installed on your system:

- **Node.js** (v16.x or later) and **npm**
- **Python** (v3.9 or later) and **pip**
- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** (recommended for local environment setup)
- **PostgreSQL** database instance
- **Redis** instance
- **Kafka** broker (or use a local Kafka setup via Docker Compose)

### Quick Setup with Docker Compose

The recommended way to run the entire FinFlow backend locally is using Docker Compose.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/abrar2030/FinFlow.git
    cd FinFlow/backend
    ```
2.  **Configure Environment:**
    Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory based on a provided template (if available) or the environment variables listed in the service details.
3.  **Build and Run:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
    This command will build all service images, set up the necessary network, and start all microservices, databases, and message brokers.

## API Documentation

Each service exposes its own set of RESTful endpoints. The primary API documentation is typically generated using tools like **Swagger/OpenAPI** for the FastAPI and Express services.

| Service Type | Documentation Access |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Python (FastAPI)** | Navigate to `http://localhost:<PORT>/docs` (e.g., for Transaction Service: `http://localhost:3002/docs`) |
| **TypeScript (Express)** | Endpoints are documented inline or via a separate documentation tool (check service READMEs). |

## Testing

Each service contains its own test suite for unit and integration testing.

| Service Type | Test Runner | Command to Run Tests |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **TypeScript/Node.js** | Jest or Mocha (inferred from `package.json` structure) | `npm test` (inside service directory) |
| **Python (FastAPI/Flask)** | Pytest | `pytest` (inside service directory) |

## Deployment

The architecture is designed for containerized deployment.

| Method | Description | Key Files |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Docker** | Each service has a dedicated `Dockerfile` for containerization. | `*/Dockerfile` |
| **Kubernetes** | The `credit-engine` service specifically includes a `kubernetes.yaml` manifest, suggesting a K8s deployment strategy for the ML components. | `credit-engine/kubernetes.yaml` |
