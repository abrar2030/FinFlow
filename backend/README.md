# Backend Services

## Overview

The backend directory houses the core server-side components of the FinFlow application, structured as a collection of microservices. Each service is designed to handle specific business domains within the financial management ecosystem, promoting separation of concerns, scalability, and maintainability. This architecture allows for independent deployment and scaling of services based on demand patterns, while facilitating team autonomy during development.

The backend is built using TypeScript, leveraging its strong typing system to enhance code quality and developer experience. The microservices communicate with each other through well-defined APIs and event-driven patterns, ensuring loose coupling between components.

## Service Architecture

The backend consists of the following key services:

The Accounting Service manages financial records, transactions, and account balances. It handles the core accounting functionality including ledger entries, transaction categorization, and financial reporting capabilities.

The Analytics Service processes financial data to generate insights, trends, and forecasts. It implements algorithms for spending pattern analysis, budget adherence tracking, and financial health indicators.

The Authentication Service manages user identity, authentication, and authorization. It handles user registration, login, session management, and role-based access control across the application.

The Common directory contains shared utilities, interfaces, and helper functions used across multiple services. This promotes code reuse and consistency throughout the backend.

The Credit Engine evaluates creditworthiness, manages loan applications, and handles credit-related operations. It implements risk assessment algorithms and integrates with external credit scoring services.

The Payments Service processes financial transactions, integrates with payment gateways, and manages payment methods. It handles payment processing, recurring payments, and transaction status tracking.

## Technology Stack

The backend services are built with:

- Node.js as the runtime environment
- TypeScript for type-safe development
- Express.js for API routing and middleware
- MongoDB for document storage
- PostgreSQL for relational data
- Redis for caching and session management
- Kafka for event streaming between services
- Jest for unit and integration testing
- Docker for containerization
- Kubernetes for orchestration

## Development Setup

To set up the backend development environment:

1. Ensure you have Node.js (v16+) and npm installed
2. Install Docker and Docker Compose for local service dependencies
3. Clone the repository and navigate to the backend directory
4. Install dependencies for all services:

```bash
cd backend
npm run install:all
```

5. Set up environment variables by copying the example files:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

6. Start the development environment:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start all services in development mode with hot reloading enabled.

## Service Communication

Services communicate through:

- RESTful APIs for synchronous request-response patterns
- Kafka events for asynchronous communication
- gRPC for high-performance internal service communication

## Testing

Each service includes comprehensive test suites. To run tests:

```bash
# Run tests for all services
npm run test

# Run tests for a specific service
npm run test:accounting-service
```

## Deployment

The services are designed to be deployed as Docker containers, orchestrated with Kubernetes. CI/CD pipelines automatically build, test, and deploy services when changes are merged to the main branch.

## Monitoring and Logging

All services implement structured logging and expose metrics endpoints for monitoring. The logs and metrics are collected by the monitoring stack (Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK) defined in the monitoring directory.

## API Documentation

API documentation is generated automatically from code annotations and is available at `/api-docs` when running each service. The comprehensive API documentation for all services is also available in the docs directory.

## Contributing

When contributing to the backend services:

1. Follow the established code style and architecture patterns
2. Ensure proper test coverage for new features
3. Document APIs using OpenAPI/Swagger annotations
4. Update relevant documentation when making significant changes

The backend architecture is designed to be extensible, allowing for the addition of new services as the application's requirements evolve.
